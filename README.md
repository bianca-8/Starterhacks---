<h2>Inspiration</h2>
The many annoying geese we see outside and we see that they can be agressive and even sometimes chase people. We wanted to turn that idea into a fun game, with the goose as the enemy.

<h2>What it does</h2>
A game where you try to avoid the geese and collect the dots. Collect dots to gain points. Collect sticks to keep in your inventory. You can hide from the geese by putting down sticks, and they become fences to shield you from the geese. But don't put down too many fences or you will become stuck!
<p>Use WASD or the arrow keys to move the character. Use the space key to place down fences. Look for the point count and stick count at the top of the page.</p>

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
A LOT... We are not that familiar with classes and objects. A lot of code didn't work (basically everything we did at some point did not work) but then we made it all work!
<p>For example:</p>
<li>Getting the animations to work and move correctly</li>
<li>Getting the goose to move around by itself</li>
<li>Having the sticks place down after pressing the space key</li>


<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
<li>Having a full working game!</li>
<li>Getting the animation of the character and goose to work.</li> 
<li>The character has pink hair! (which is created completely by us)</li>

<h2>What we learned</h2>
<li>We learned a lot of new python and pygame syntax.</li>
<li>Github pushing/commit, pull, and merge. We did not know about it before and it made collaboration through VS code way easier. </li>

<h2>What's next for Beak Brawl</h2>
<li>Multiplayer!</li> 
<li>Play online against other people.</li> 
<li>Adding more geese (makes it harder)!</li>
<li>Being able to pick up the fences and have them turn back into sticks to place somewhere else.</li>

<h2>Built With</h2>
<li>Figma</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Pygame</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
