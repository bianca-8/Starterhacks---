Pitch:
Are you stressed? Do you hate the geese that poop on the ground and you step on it? Did you just ruin your new shoes? 

The solution: (Legally) Kill it and eat it!
Since you canâ€™t actually kill a goose in Canada (Insert photo) since open season is Sept 1 to Dec 6 and you can only bag 5 geese at a time
We have designed a game to allow you to vent your anger against the geese and cooking up a delicious meal
